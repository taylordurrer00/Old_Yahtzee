-------------------------------------------------------[     DESCRIPTION    ]--

I made this Yahtzee game as my final project for AP Computer Science in 10th
grade.  The instructions for the assignment were to "make a game"; we weren't 
given any other tools or instructions.  This meant every student had to plan,
desgin, and program their own games before the school year ended in just a few
weeks.  The teacher said that it was more important for the game to work than 
for it to be coded well.  Because I was worried about the time constraint, I
stuck to what I was more comfortable with and went for simplicity.  This means 
that the game was coded poorly, however I finished it on time.  If you would 
like to see my updated version of this game where I used what I learned at 
school to rewrite it with immense improvements, please see my Improved_Yahtzee.
